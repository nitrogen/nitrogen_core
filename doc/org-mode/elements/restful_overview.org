#+HTML: <div class=headline>Nitrogen Restful Elements</div>

* Overview

  Restful elements introduce the possibility to create forms that don't
  depend on AJAX/Javascript. This is sometimes useful, for example if you
  want to provide a fallback option when a client does not support
  javascript or sits behind a firewall that filters active content.

* Demo

  Check out the [[http://nitrogenproject.com/demos/restful][RESTful Forms Demo]]
  
* How it works

  Restful requests work a little different compared to the rest of
  Nitrogen. They don't use the event mechanism. Instead you have to
  render the reply either on a different page or check if
  wf:q(restful\_method) is set to "post" or "get" depending on the
  method of the form.  Form elements that don't rely on javascript are
  useable in restful\_form elements. The elements that are supported are
  described below.

  Each control within a #restful\_form{} element will submit its Nitrogen
  id as the name of the field, unless overridden by specifying an html\_name
  on the restful elements.

* Replaced and new elements

** New Elements

   + [[./restful_form.org][restful\_form]]

** Replaced elements
   Some elements are replaced with restful\_ counterparts:

# <<1>>

   + [[./restful_submit.org][restful\_submit]] and [[./restful_reset.org][restful\_reset]] instead of [[./button.org][button]] 
   + [[./restful_upload][restful\_upload]] instead of upload

* Supported elements

  + [[./textbox.org][Textbox]]
  + [[./textarea.org][Textarea]]
  + [[./checkbox.org][Checkbox]]
  + [[./dropdown.org][Dropdown]]
  + [[./password.org][Password Box]]
  + [[./hidden.org][Hidden Value]]
  + [[./radio.org][Radio Button]]

* No support for validators
  Validators are not currently supported for restful\_submit actions, so be sure extra sure to check your inputs.

* Example
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  case wf:q(restful_method) of
    "post" -> [
        % this is code is executed after the submit button was pressed

        #table{rows=[
            #tablerow{cells=[
                #tablecell{text="text_input"},
                #tablecell{text=wf:q(text_input)}
            ]}
         ]};
    _else -> [
        % this code is executed when restful_method is "get" 
        % or undefined

        #restful_form{id=restful_form, method=post, body=[
           #table{rows=[
                #tablerow{cells=[
                    #tablecell{text="text_input"},
                    #tablecell{body=[#textbox{id=text_input}]}
               ]}
            ]},
            #restful_reset{},
            #restful_submit{}
         ]}
    ]
  end
#+END_SRC
