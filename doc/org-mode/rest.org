* Overview

  Nitrogen's default route handler gives you an easy way to add a no-nonsense
  RESTful handler to a page module. If you need to add a simple a RESTful
  interface without wanting to deal with Webmachine or Cowboy's restful
  handlers, and just use straight up Nitrogen, you can do this trivially.

  Simply stated, if you add =-behaviour(nitrogen_rest).= to a module, instead
  of looking for a =main()= function as the entry point, it will instead expect
  an entry point based on the HTTP request method used.  So a =GET= request
  will look for a =get()= function, and so on.

  Each Entry Point function expects a single argument, =PathInfo=, which is
  exactly yhe same information that would be retrieved from calling
  =wf:path_info()=.

** Request Methods Module Entry Points

   Commonly used Request methods and their corresponding entry points

   + =GET= :: =get(PathInfo)=
   + =POST= :: =post(PathInfo)=
   + =PUT= :: =put(PathInfo)=
   + =DELETE= :: =delete(PathInfo)=
   
   Less commonly used Request methods:

   + =CONNECT= :: =connect(PathInfo)=
   + =TRACE= :: =trace(PathInfo)=
   + =OPTIONS= :: =options(PathInfo)=

   (You might notice the pattern here: the HTTP status code is made lower-case
   and converted to an atom, and that is the function called.

** Return values of entry points

   All the above functions are expected to return either a =Body=, which can be
   a typical Nitrogen body (with Nitrogen elements), or a 2-tuple,
   ={StatusCode, Body}=, where StatusCode is the HTTP status code of the
   return. If only a =Body= is returned, the =StatusCode= is the standard 200
   status code.
