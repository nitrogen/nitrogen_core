* AJAX Updates
# <<1>>

  TargetID can refer to the name of an element, or it can be a JQuery
  selector path. See [[./paths.org][Element Paths]] for more information.

  For every one of these functions which offer a =Priority= argument,
  =Priority= can be either the atom =eager=, =normal=, or =defer=. =eager= will
  always execute before =normal=, which will always execute before =defer=.

  Any wiring which does not explicitly specify a priority will wire at =normal=
  priority.

** wf:set(TargetID, Value) -> ok
** wf:set(Priority, TargetID, Value) -> ok
   Update a form element (textbox, dropdown, checkbox, etc) to set text value
   of TargetID. Can also be used to set the =src= attribute of an image tag.
   
** wf:enable(Target) -> ok
** wf:enable(Priority, Target) -> ok
   Enables the target form field or button.

** wf:disable(Target) ->
** wf:disable(Priority, Target) ->
   Disables the target form field or button.

** wf:update(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:update(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Update the contents of TargetID with a new set of Nitrogen Elements.

** wf:replace(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:replace(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Replace TargetID with a new set of Nitrogen Elements.

** wf:remove(TargetID) -> ok
** wf:remove(Priority, TargetID) -> ok
   Remove TargetID from the DOM.
   
** wf:insert\_top(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:insert\_top(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Insert Nitrogen Elements at the top of TargetID (within the contents of
   TargetID), shifting the existing contents downward.
   
** wf:insert\_bottom(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:insert\_bottom(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Insert Nitrogen Elements at the bottom of the TargetID (within the contents
   of TargetID), below the existing contents.

** wf:insert\_before(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:insert\_before(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Insert Nitrogen Elements before TargetID in the DOM, shifting the existing
   contents downward.
   
** wf:insert\_after(TargetID, Elements) -> ok
** wf:insert\_after(Priority, TargetID, Elements) -> ok
   Insert Nitrogen Elements after TargetID in the DOM, below the existing
   contents.

** wf:flash(Elements) -> ok
   Insert the Nitrogen Elements as a new flash message.

* Convenience Functions
# <<2>>

** wf:f(Format, Data) -> String or Binary

   Convenience function to format a string similar to
   io\_lib:format(Format, Data). Returns a flattened list.

   Note, if =Format= is a binary, the return type will be a binary, and if
   =Format= is a string, the return type will be a string.
   
** wf:coalesce([List]) -> Item

   Return the first element in the list that is not 'undefined'.
   
** wf:is\_string(Term) -> Bool

   Return true if the Term is an Erlang string. That is, a flat list
   of integers.
   
** wf:to\_list(Term) -> List

   Convert the supplied term to a flat list, if possible. Useful for
   turning Integers, Atoms, Binaries into Strings.
   
** wf:to\_atom(Term) -> Atom

   Convert the supplied term into an Atom, if possible. Useful for
   turning Integers, Binaries, and Strings into Atoms.

** wf:to\_existing\_atom(Term) -> Atom

   Convert the supplied term to an Atom that already exists in the Erlang VM.
   Same as =wf:to_atom/1= but safer when in doubt. (see
   [[http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/advanced.html][the advanced section of the Erlang docs pertaining to atoms]]).

** wf:to\_binary(Term) -> Binary

   Convert the supplied term into a Binary, if possible. Useful for
   turning Integers, Atoms, and Strings into Binaries.

** wf:to\_integer(Term) -> Integer

   Convert the supplied term into an Integer, if possible. Useful for turning Atoms, Strings, and Binaries into Integers.

** wf:html\_encode(String) -> EncodedString

   HTML encode the supplied String, converting things like < and > into &lt; and &gt;.

** wf:html\_decode(String) -> DecodedString

   HTML decoding decode the supplied String, converting things like &lt; and &gt; into < and >.

** wf:url\_encode(String) -> EncodedString

   URL encode the supplied String, converting potentially URL-breaking characters into percent notation (%XX).

** wf:url\_decode(String) -> DecodedString

   URL decode the supplied String, converting a percent-encoded String into a normal String.

** wf:to\_qs(PropList) -> EncodedQueryString

   Encode a PropList (a list of ={Key, Value}= tuples) into a URL-encoded query string (returned as an IOList).

** wf:hex\_encode(String) -> EncodedString.
  
   Hex-encode the supplied String.

** wf:hex\_decode(String) -> DecodedString

   Convert a hex-encoded String to a normal String.

** wf:temp\_id() -> String

   Return a temp id. Useful for naming an Element so that you can
   refer to it during a postback later, without giving it a specific
   name.

** wf:js\_escape(String) -> EscapedString

   Convert a String to a JS-safe string by adding backslashes to quotes and newlines.

** wf:json\_encode(Data) -> JsonEncodedString

   Convert a data structure (Proplist, list, etc) to a JSON encoded string.

** wf:json\_decode(JsonEncodedString) ->

   Convert a JSON-encoded string back to an Erlang data structure.

** wf:join([Terms],Delimiter) -> [Terms]

   Because Erlang doesn't provide a means to join a list in a non-string fashion, this will join the =Terms= on the delimiter, regardless of the type of =Delimiter=.

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   wf:join([Line1,Line2,Line2],#br{}).
#+END_SRC

* Event Wiring
# <<3>>
   
** wf:wire(Actions) -> ok

   Wire actions to the page. The Actions are applied against the entire page unless a
   trigger or target are specified within the action itself.

   For example, show a Javascript alert:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   wf:wire(#alert { text="Hello, World!" })
#+END_SRC
   
** wf:wire(TargetID, Actions) -> ok

   Wire actions to the page, targeted against supplied TargetID.
   For example, hide a Panel:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   wf:wire(PanelID, #hide {})
#+END_SRC

** wf:wire(TriggerID, TargetID, Actions) -> ok

   Wire actions to the page, triggering on the supplied TriggerID and targeting against
   the supplied TargetID. This allows you to wire actions (such as #event) that listen
   to a click on one element and modify a different element.

   For example, when a button is clicked, hide a panel:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   wf:wire(ButtonID, PanelID, #event { type=click, actions=#hide {} })
#+END_SRC

** wf:eager(Actions) -> ok
** wf:eager(TargetID, Actions) -> ok
** wf:eager(TriggerID, TargetID, Actions) -> ok

   Wire actions to the page, however, execute the actions before any
   normal or deferred priority wired actions.

** wf:defer(Actions) -> ok
** wf:defer(TargetID, Actions) -> ok
** wf:defer(TriggerID, TargetID, Actions) -> ok

   Wire actions to the page, however, execute these actions after any
   normal or eager priority wired actions.

** wf:continue(Tag, Function, IntervalInMS, TimeoutInMS) -> ok

   Spawn the provided function (arity 0) and tell the browser to poll for the results at the specified interval, with a timeout setting.
   so See [[http://nitrogenproject.com/demos/continuations][continuations example]] for usage.

* Asynchronous Page Updates (Comet, Continuations)
# <<4>>

** wf:comet(Function) -> {ok, Pid}

   Spawn a comet function, and tell the browser to open a COMET request to receive the results in real time.
   See [[http://nitrogenproject.com/web/samples/comet1][example 1]], [[http://nitrogenproject.com/web/samples/comet2][example 2]], and [[http://nitrogenproject.com/web/samples/comet3][example 3]] for usage.

** wf:comet(Function, LocalPool) -> {ok, Pid}

   Spawn a function connected to the specified local pool.

** wf:comet\_global(Function, GlobalPool) -> {ok, Pid}

   Spawn a function connected to the specified global pool.

** wf:send(LocalPool, Message)

   Send the specified message to all comet functions connected to the
   specified local pool.

** wf:send\_global(GlobalPool, Message)

   Send the specified message to all comet function connected to the
   specified GlobalPool.
   
** wf:flush() -> ok

   Normally, the results of a comet function are sent to the browser when the function exits.
   =flush/0= pushes results to the browser immediately, useful for a looping comet function.

** wf:async\_mode()

   Return the current async mode, either =comet= or ={poll, IntervalInMS}=.

** wf:async\_mode(Mode)

   Set the current async mode, either =comet= or ={poll, IntervalInMS}=.

** wf:switch\_to\_comet()

   Run all current and future async processes in comet mode. This uses more
   resources on the server, as HTTP connections stay open.

** wf:switch\_to\_polling(IntervalInMS)

   Run all current and future async processes in polling mode. This
   uses more resources on the client, as the application must issue a
   request every =IntervalInMS= milliseconds.

** wf:continue(Tag, Function) -> ok

   Spawn the provided function (arity 0) and tell the browser to poll for the results.
   See [[http://nitrogenproject.com/web/samples/continuations][continuations example]] for usage.
   
** wf:continue(Tag, Function, Interval) -> ok

   Spawn the provided function (arity 0) and tell the browser to poll for the results at the specified interval.
   See [[http://nitrogenproject.com/web/samples/continuations][continuations example]] for usage.

* Redirect
# <<5>>

** wf:redirect(URL) -> ok
   Redirect to the provided =URL=.
   
** wf:redirect\_to\_login(URL) -> ok

  See Below.

** wf:redirect\_to\_login(URL, PostLoginURL)= -> ok

   Redirect to the provided URL, attaching a token on the end. The receiving
   page can subsequently call =wf:redirect\_from\_login(DefaultURL)= to send
   the user to =PostLoginURL=.

   If =PostLoginURL= is not provided, it will default to the current page's
   URL.

** wf:redirect\_from\_login(DefaultURL) -> ok

   Redirect the user back to a page that called =wf:redirect_to_login(URL)= or
   to the =PostLoginURL= provided to =wf:redirect_to_login(URL, PostLoginURL)=
   If the user came to the page for some other reason, then the user is
   redirected to the provided =DefaultURL=.

* Session State
# <<6>>

** wf:session(Key) -> Value or 'undefined'

   Retrieve the session value stored under the specified key.
   For example, retrieve the value of 'count' for the current user:
   =Count = wf:session(count)=

** wf:session\_default(Key, DefaultValue) -> Value.

   Retrieve the session value stored under a specific key. If not
   found, return the supplied default value.
   
** wf:session(Key, Value) -> OldValue
   
   Store a session variable for the current user. Key and Value can be any Erlang term.
   For example, store a count: =wf:session(count, Count)=

** wf:clear\_session() -> ok

   Clear the current user's session.
   
** wf:logout() -> ok
   Clear session state, page state, identity, and roles.

* Page State
# <<7>>
   
** wf:state(Key) -> Value

   Retrieve a page state value stored under the specified key. Page State is
   different from Session State in that Page State is scoped to a series
   of requests by one user to one Nitrogen Page.

** wf:state\_default(Key, DefaultValue) -> Value.

   Retrieve a page state value stored under the specified key. If the
   value is not set, then return the supplied default value.
   
** wf:state(Key, Value) -> ok

   Store a page state variable for the current user. Page State is
   different from Session State in that Page State is scoped to a series
   of requests by one user to one Nitrogen Page.
   
** wf:clear\_state() -> ok
   Clear a user's page state.

* Authentication and Authorization
# <<8>>
   
** wf:user() -> User or 'undefined'
   Return the user value that was previously set by =wf:user(User)=

** wf:user(User) -> ok
   Set the user for the current session.
   
** wf:clear\_user() -> ok
   Same as =wf:user(undefined)=.
   
** wf:role(Role) -> 'true' or 'false'
   Check if the current user has a specified role.
   
** wf:role(Role, IsInRole) -> ok
   Set whether the current user is in a specified role. =IsInRole= should be a
   boolean (=true= or =false=)
   
** wf:clear\_roles() -> ok
   Remove the user from all roles.

* Web Request and Response
# <<9>>

** wf:q(AtomKey) -> String | undefined

   Get all query string and POST values for the provided key. If more than one
   AtomKey matches, then this will throw an error, use =wf:qs(AtomKey)=
   instead. Returns the atom =undefined= if there's no matching value.

   *Mnemonic:* Think =q= as "Query".

** wf:mq(ListOfAtomKeys) -> [ListOfStrings]

   Get the list of query string and POST values for the provided keys, and
   return the list of values for the keys. Syntactical sugar equivilant of:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   [wf:q(AtomKey) || AtomKey <- ListOfAtomKeys]
#+END_SRC

   *Mnemonic*: Think =mq= as "Multi Query".

** wf:q\_pl(ListOfAtomKeys) -> [{Key,Values},...]

   Takes a list of keys returns a proplist of keys and respective values from query string and POST values.

   *Mnemonic*: Think =q_pl= as "Query Proplist"

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  wf:qs_pl([favorite_robot,favorite_dinosaur,favorite_hobbit])
#+END_SRC

  Returns something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  [
      {favorite_robot,"Optimus Prime"},
      {favorite_dinosaur,"Velociraptor"},
      {favorite_hobbit,"Samwise"}
  ].

#+END_SRC


** wf:qs(AtomKey) -> [String]

   Get a list of query string and POST values for the provided
   key. (This acts like =wf:q(AtomKey)= in Nitrogen 1.0.)
  
   *Mnemonic:* Think =qs= as "Query Plural"

** wf:mqs(ListOfAtomKeys) -> [ListOfStrings]

   Get a list of query string and POST values for the provided list of keys.  Syntactical sugar equivilant of:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   [wf:qs(AtomKey) || AtomKey <- ListOfAtomKeys]
#+END_SRC

   *Mnemonic*: Think =mqs= as "Multi Query Plural"

** wf:qs\_pl(ListOfAtomKeys) -> [{Key,ListOfValues},...]

   Takes a list of keys and returns a proplist of keys and respective list of values from the query string and POST values.

   *Mnemonic*: Think =qs_pl= as "Query Plurals into a Proplist"

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  wf:qs_pl([fruit,veggie,meat])
#+END_SRC

  Returns something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  [
     {fruit,["Apple","Peach"]},
     {veggie,["Broccoli"]},
     {meat,["Pork","Beef","Venison"]}
  ].
#+END_SRC


** wf:request\_body() -> String
   Return the complete text of the request body to the server. Note, this value 
   will use the context of the current request. For example, the result of calling 
   this during the page's initial request will be different than calling it within
   a postback event.

** wf:status\_code(IntegerCode) -> ok
   Set the HTTP response code. Default is 200.
   
** wf:content\_type(ContentType) -> ok

   Set the HTTP content type. Defaults is "text/html". This can be
   used to return text images or other files to the browser, rather than returning 
   HTML.

** wf:download\_as(Filename) -> ok

   Set the HTTP Content-Disposition header in such a way that the browser will
   treat the page as a download with the specified =Filename=.

** wf:request\_method() -> atom()

   Return the HTTP request method used (=POST=, =GET=, =PUT=, etc), as a
   lower-case atom (example: =post=, =get=, and =put=).

** wf:url() -> String

   Return the complete requested URL for the page. For exaple, if the request
   is for =http://myapp.com/some/file?some_qs=, the return is
   ="http://myapp.com/some/file?some_qs".

** wf:uri() -> String

   Return the complete requested URI for the page. Note, this does not include
   the protocol (http/https) or the hostname. For example, if the request is for
   =http://myapp.com/some/file?some_qs=, the return is ="/some/file?some_qs"=).

** wf:path() -> String

   Return the string of the requested path.  This excludes any query_string
   information. For example, if the request is for
   =http://myapp.com/some/file?some_qs= the return value is ="/some/file"=

** wf:path\_info() -> String

   Return only the path info for the requested page module. In other words, if
   the module web\_my\_page is requsted with the path
   ="/web/my/page/some/extra/stuff= then =wf:path_info()= would return
   ="some/extra/stuff"=.
   
** wf:page\_module() -> Atom

   Return the requested page module. Useful information to know when writing a
   custom element or action.

** wf:protocol() -> http | https

   Return whether the request to the server is made by HTTP or HTTPS. Note,
   that if the request is made behind a proxy, this will only return whether
   the request from the proxy to the server is in HTTP or HTTPS, so the
   protocol seen by Nitrogen might not be the same protocol used by the client.

** wf:peer\_ip() -> IPAddress (4-tuple or 8-tuple)


   Return the IP address of the client. Note that Erlang IP Addresses are
   4-tuples (IPv4) or 8-tuples (IPv6). For example: ={127,0,0,}= or
   ={8193,3512,51966,47806,0,0,0,1}=

** wf:peer\_ip(ListOfProxies) -> IPAddress (4-tuple or 8-tuple)

   Shortcut method for =wf:peer_ip(ListOfProxies, x_forwarded_for)=

** wf:peer\_ip(ListOfProxies, ForwardedHeader) -> IPAddress (4-tuple or 8-tuple)

   This will compare the peer\_ip address against the provided list of proxies,
   and if any of them match the connected IP, then return the IP address from
   the =ForwardedHeader=.

* Cookies
# <<10>>

** wf:cookies() -> [{AtomKey, StringValue}].

   Return a proplist of all cookies.

** wf:cookie(Key) -> String

   Get the value of a cookie.

** wf:cookie\_default(Key, Default) -> String.

   Get the value of a cookie, if it doesn't exist, return the default.

** wf:cookie(Key, Value) -> ok

   Tell Nitrogen to set a cookie on the browser. Uses \"/\" for the Path, and Nitrogen's
   session timeout setting for the MinutesToLive value.
   
** wf:cookie(Key, Value, Path, MinutesToLive) -> ok

   Tell Nitrogen to set a cookie on the browser under the specified Path that is valid
   for a certain number of minutes.

** wf:delete\_cookie(Key) -> ok

   Tell Nitrogen to set the cookie to expire immediately, effectively deleting it from 
   the browser.  Is a shortcut for =wf:cookie(Key,"","/",0)=.
