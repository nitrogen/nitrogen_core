## RESTful Upload Element - #restful_upload {}
  The button element produces an HTML input element that has type
  attribute 'file'. The input element represents a file-choose dialog.
  When the restful_submit element is clicked, the chosen file will be
  uploaded to the server.
  To fetch the content of the uploaded file, You first have to get the
  request-bridge by calling 'wf_context:request_bridge()'; after
  that you have to query for the uploaded file by searching
  the elements returnd by 'post_files()'.

### Usage

   #restful_upload { id = upload, text="Go!" },
   %% later on return 
   Req = wf_context:request_bridge(),
   UploadedFiles = Req:post_files(),
   %% ...

```
