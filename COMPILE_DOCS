COMPILING THE NITROGEN DOCUMENTATION


compiling the documentation uses Org-mode for Emacs and a simple Perl script for adding Disqus comments.

Editing the HTML is not recommended, as the org-mode compiler just overwrites all HTML anyway. Instead, edit the org-mode files found in doc/org-mode.

Make sure you have emacs installed, with htmlize (version 1.34 or later), erlang-mode, and org-mode installed.

On Ubuntu, these packages can all be installed with:

sudo apt-get install emacs erlang-mode org-mode emacs-goodies-el


Then you can compile the docs from the command line with

$ make docs


Also worth noting is that the Disqus comment injection script expects perl to be in the PATH
